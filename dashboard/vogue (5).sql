He wouldn’t have allowed you to see today if he knows you will not be able to handle what today would bring. Life is not a bed of roses where you can wish for a particular thing and have it the following morning; no matter what life brings to you, God knows that you are strong enough to handle it.

The Bible provides enough texts on His Second coming and I believe they are adequate enough to erase any doubt about His coming back to the earth. By His first coming He secured our place in heaven through the redemption of mankind by His own precious blood but His Second coming will take us to the actual heaven He has prepared for us. I like to refer the Second coming as the harvest of the First coming.\r\nThough God’s Word has sufficient prophecy on the first and second coming of Jesus, many of God’s children have not acquaint themselves with this basic truth because they have not been properly taught  of the events and sequence of events that will characterize His coming and as such they are not mindful of this precious moment. The trouble is we have raised believers that only think about this present world; they have mastered the acts and the systems of this current world but have less or no thought about the world to come. I think any Christian that gives no thought or lack basic information of where he or she will spend his eternity is no better than the man who doesn’t believe in eternity.\r\nAnd Just like Apostle Paul has asserted in 1 Corinthians 15:19 to address some believers at Corinth who do not believe in the bodily resurrection of the dead that “If only for this life we have hope in Christ, we are of all people most to be pitied”. Oh yes, there is life after death and Life after this life, and the same way our spirit being was redeemed at New birth, the same way  would be the redemption of our body at the rapture of the saints (Romans 8:23). The day of the Lord will come just as the Bible prophesied!\r\nOn this background I write this timely book; “The Coming of the Lord”. This book covers the entire signs that will characterize the end times as prelude to His actual coming and the events of His second coming in sequential order. This does not just proffer mental information to the readers but also offers a spiritually impacted message to position all believers in Christ for the glorious day of the Lord.\r\nIn this classic, you will learn about:\r\n-Several Myths that have been paraded as truths by the Church for years;\r\n-The Signs to look out for as His coming draws nearer;\r\n-How to adequately prepare for Christ Glorious day;\r\n-The Rapture and the After Events;\r\n-The Detailed programs and agenda of Jesus at His Second coming;\r\n-The New Jerusalem: the beloved City of the Lord and its Glamour.\r\n', 'Show', 'May 08, 2021', 'January 22, 2021'),

But more to being born again is a call to responsibility.  Every one of us has been called into a greater task in the body of Christ, and you must locate your area of function.\r\nThe Church of Jesus Christ has achieved less or rather could have achieved more if every of its component parts are functioning effectively. Romans 12:5 read; “so we, being many, are one body in Christ and every one member’s one of another”.\r\nThe bible says “… we are one body in Christ”. In other words, every part of the body has a role to play. You see no one part function exactly like the others, and if such parts that are meant to work for the effectual working of others are idle then, the impact of the Church is impaired.\r\nThe larger numbers of people in Churches today are mere watchers, receivers, and not contributors.  And there is no space for the onlookers in the body. Every part of the body was formed to perform, to ease, to encourage and strengthen other parts.\r\nWhen you look through the pews, you will startle. You will see amazing potentials, unused talents, and untapped gifts; men and women with so much abilities running away from the Master’s use. They would rather sing their songs in their rooms than bless the congregation with it.\r\nI believe it is the responsibility of pastors to teach the people to rather be an asset to the body than being “burdensome”, a position which some have occupied.  We may not all sings, some could, but others can administrate, usher in people, greet people, conduct service for children, decorate, clean the toilet, preach for pastor, carry pastor’s bible, do protocol, coordinate service, produce good sound for service, give for ministry programs, and still counting. I mean there is no hidden place for any!\r\n I would have you know also that no part is inferior to the others; everyone is equally needed and equally important. Imagine if the toilet is not cleaned up, and the smell permeates through the service. You see no matter how anointed the congregation were they can never get the best from such service. So every part is important whether they appear in the camera or behind it.\r\nI believe this book will help so many idle part of the body to begin taking responsibility. You see the delay we have experienced so far may just be because you have not added your quota. And when you do you become a plus to the body. I pray that after reading this book, the Holy Spirit, the Father of light, will turn you on, and you will find and take your place in the larger picture.

From all these, it is written that He has been given a name that is above all other names in heaven and on earth. \r\nIn spiritual warfare, one of the most potent weapons is the use of the name of Jesus Christ.

In John 16:23(b), the Lord Jesus Christ had said Himself; and it is written: “whatever you ask the Father in My name, He will give you”. Similarly, Psalm 124:8 says that: “our help is in the name of the Lord”. \r\nWith this backdrop, this book is hereby made available to enable you call on God in the appropriate name of Jesus Christ that meets your particular situation or circumstance of life, whenever needed by you at any point in time. \r\nFor instance, among other needs of life,\r\n•	If you are hungry for food or for any substantial progress/success in your endeavor, please call on the Bread of Life, and He will feed you well round-about.\r\n•	Are you thirsty for anything in particular?

When God wants to pass His message to man, it does it through Angelic beings and often time, they are allowed a free will to communicate the bidding of the Father to us.\r\nAs long as we want to come into the full fledged of our mandate in life then we need an acquaintance with the Ministry of Angels. Angels are God’s special messengers and they seem to be the link between heavenly agenda and the earthly manifestation. Most times God revealed His plan through Angelic beings and as much as we fellowship with the Spirit of God, we must have idea how those answers may be convened to us.\r\nLike human beings, Angels also have emotions and they do by responding to our emotions and are touched by our personal feelings but they don’t act based on feelings, they only act based on divine command. The inability of some Christians to understand their precious Ministry: what the Angels are sent to do, make them a victim of circumstance instead of a victor in Christ.\r\nThere are more than 250 mentions of Angels in Scripture from Genesis to Revelation.

Jesus came with a proclamation of freedom; He is saying; “you’re now free from anything that has kept you in bondage for years, you don’t have to be in bondage anymore, it’s over with me”.\r\nAmazingly only few people have acknowledge the reality of this fact. Even Christians who have accepted His call of freedom, and are now set free from oppression of the enemy are not living in the balanced truth of His deliverance. It’s great to understand that you are now free but greater to know what this freedom came with; I mean the essence of our liberty in Him.\r\nThe Church of Jesus Christ has delved too long on the elementary issues of the Gospel that It hardly enjoys the full load of Christ benefits. So many untold controversies in the body, but the Word of God are very direct on any issue of life.\r\nI’ve heard people say God’s Word is mysterious: God works in mysterious ways and so cannot be understood by mortals. I think they are just being emotional about God. Looking through the scripture, you will understand that the Word explains the personality of God. And His Word is so close to you, and so God can be understood. \r\nMoses had once written in his fifth book of the Pentateuch, Deuteronomy 30:14:\r\n“But the Word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it”.\r\nHis Word had made things simple. You can’t really say any subject is complicated in the bible. There is no complexity with the Word. The only thing that has made complexity out of the Word of God is the people interpreting it. And by this I am not just talking about preachers, but you inclusive!\r\nA lot had been said, or written on the subject of deliverance. Some of which are based on biblical truths, others are just mere mental philosophy and emotion based. And this poses confusion among us. But really, there is nothing to be confused about! He said” the word is very nigh unto thee…” In the nutshell: “get the truth all by yourself; you don’t have to do it because someone said it but the Word”.\r\nIf you will permit the Spirit of understanding permeates through your being as you digest this book, you will understand that the truth had always been true, you just didn’t know it yourself.\r\nMy utmost prayer is that you will be impacted with the truth and then walk in the finished work of our Lord Jesus Christ. And in whatever way ignorance might have made you a victim of circumstance, the light in the knowledge of His Word will make you free, and you will receive boldness to walk in the balanced truth.\r\n', 'Show', 'May 06, 2021', 'May 06, 2021'),

School is not a place but an opportunity to have light, to learn and disseminate the knowledge. Anything outside all these tends to a mirage.\r\nWe cannot rely solely on dedicated teachers to deliver the understanding and personal qualities young people will need. Instead we must connect what happens in schools to wider opportunities for learning. Setting yourself up for success is no easy feat; there are a lot of things that can get in the way of your pursuits along the way and it\'s important to be prepared for the worst. Successful people don\'t become overnight. They learnt beyond the classroom and turned their ordinary learning to great achievements.\r\nIn Beyond the Classroom: How ordinary students become extraordinary achievers in life, the author provides welcoming and encouraging rules to rule as students. Becoming a great achiever isn\'t out of your reach if you truly aspire to learn beyond the four walls of the classroom. All you need is a little instruction to get you started and you\'ll be well on your way to a happy and fulfilling life. Therefore, in this inspiring piece lies; rules, secrets, nuggets, life-lessons on how ordinary students become extraordinary achievers in life.\r\n\r\n\r\nBeyond the Classroom: How Ordinary Students become Great Achievers in Life  shows that creating an education revolution requires us to think far more radically about the options for reform, and outlines a vision of real education.

In an age that is fully laced with exposures to the internet and social media, parenting generally is a huge task. Whoever is not ready to make the sacrifices needed to meet up with the demands and the responsibilities of raising a family in this unique generation will find it quite difficult to cope, and worse still, will have many genuine excuses for his/her failures in parenting later on in life.\r\n\r\nWhoever claims child-rearing is more difficult than raising teenagers, has not really raised a teen yet. Learning to be parents to teenagers is extremely more demanding than parenting generally, especially with the volume of information available at the fingertips of these teens. It takes a lot of effort, training, education, and reorientation, especially if you desire to do it in the way of the Lord. Due to the huge effort required, most parents are awfully exhausted from their experiences of raising their teenagers.\r\n\r\nRaising teens of exceptional qualities takes tremendous efforts and will likely stretch you extensively. This is because most teenagers naturally do not think things through before taking actions, since they are not yet as experienced as adults, and actions taken at such times can bring out the worst in their parents. Once in a while, they can get you confused as to what a good parent really is! At some point, it is not unusual to start feeling as though you are losing control of them. In fact, most parents of the social-media-generation teens feel exactly as you do. They feel they really need help in order to do a better parenting job. So, you are not alone on this bumpy road.\r\n\r\nAt times, you just feel like a total failure, because, no matter how hard you try, there seems to be no visible improvement in either their lifestyle or their way of doing things. It appears as though they find it very difficult to do the right things and always find it so easy, more often than not, to do the wrong things; the exact things that get you mad at them always. Although this is a very terrible state to find yourself as a parent, it really does not mean you have failed in your parenting efforts. So, do not see yourself as a failure yet. You are just like every other parent too, who wants the best for their teenagers, and who are not getting the exact results they expected. Do not give up yet, there is still a glimpse of light at the end of the tunnel.\r\n\r\nSincerely, your teenagers may look unruly today, but with proper parenting techniques, they can be reshaped into dignified personalities tomorrow. Teenagers are really not difficult to handle. They can be great fun to work with. You only need to learn how to deal with them maturely so as to get the best of your desires out of them.\r\n\r\nIt is a good thing that you are starting on a great note today by your decision to educate yourself on how to raise your teens in a better way, which will ultimately make you a better parent. Your unconscious action to study this book is a sign that you admit there is something more you need to learn about raising teenagers. It shows you have a desire to be a better parent to your teen than your parents were to you as a teenager.', 'Show', 'September 20, 2021', 'September 20, 2021'),

No man can succeed alone, so it is important for a man to have people through whom he can succeed. Nothing can compare with having helpers in life. Having people that can help you is greater than knowing how to fast but most people have little or no knowledge about divine helpers and that is why the Lord has chosen to bring out this book to open the mind and hearts of many people to the kind of helpers they must have.\r\n\r\nI wrote on the 12 helpers you must have just as we have 12 months in a year. And for God to use each of these helpers for his children thereby making life easier for us all. What is Divine Help? Divine Help or Mercy is something man does not work for. It is something nobody is entitled to and you see some people that do not know how to fast but their lives are way better than the lives of those that can fast.\r\n\r\nFor his saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion. So then it is not of him that willet or of him that runnet, but of God that shows mercy. Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy and whom will harden. Rom.9:15-18.\r\n\r\nYou can see what God said about mercy, that it is not of him that runneth. Some people take pride in fasting and prayer not knowing God does wonder only by His Mercy. I want all children of God to be enlightened and ask God to show them mercy. Even in heaven, God will judge with mercy and this is one of the reasons why I wrote this BOOK so you can know how to ask God for mercy and how you should also have mercy on other people. Because if you do not show mercy to people, you also can not receive mercy from God. “With the merciful, thou will shew thyself merciful and with the upright man thou wit shew thyself upright”.(2 Sam 22:26).\r\n\r\nIf you want to be surrounded by these helpers, you must also be a helper to other people. Those of you that know how to help pray and fast for long days, always ask for mercy in your prayers. Because many people that you do not expect to see in heaven will get there through mercy. According to the word of God in (James 2:13) “For he shall have judgment without mercy which hath showed no mercy: and mercy rejoiceth against judgment”.\r\n\r\nThe sins David committed are more than that of Eli and God changed the covenant he made with Eli’s family and cursed him instead. His two children died in one day. David stopped Him from changing his covenant with Him.\r\n\r\nDavid even counted the Israelites and God killed seventy thousand Israelites (70,000) (1 Chronicle 21) but none of David\'s children, wives, or even David himself was killed. David, the offender was now begging God to stop the killing and punish him instead because he committed the sin and not the Israelites. God stopped the killings but mercy stopped God from harming David. What more can we say about David killing Uriah because of his wife. When God wanted to avenge Uriah, the son Uriah\'s wife had for David died. The child was not the one that sinned but he bore the consequences of David\'s sin because mercy did not allow God to harm David but the innocent child that knew nothing about the sin.

Having a careless attitude may affect such a person and whenever he sees the mark, he may not work on it because of this attitude. What I know is that there is no good thing that happens in the life of a man physically. It first happens in the spiritual, before manifesting in the physical. However, does God not reveal all to us in our dreams. “The secret things belong to the LORD our God, but those things which are revealed belong to us and to our children forever, that we may do all the words of this law”. Deut. 29:29. What God wants people to know about events or the mark that will happen to them is what you can also know. The duty of man is to pray while God’s duty is to answer the prayers.\r\n\r\nIn this mark, you will see how great men fell in battle and how some people rose up from the pit to honorable places. Anybody who wants to succeed in this world must work on understanding marks so that they will not cry back to heaven the way they cried on the day of their birth. Some people believe that God created some set of people to succeed while He created some to fail in life. But the truth is that everyone who came into this world wants to succeed but not everyone will because for you to succeed, you need to take the steps necessary to put you on the path of your success. Whosoever is ready to take the step and follow it diligently will succeed? For those who relax, however, calamities, trials and tribulations will keep afflicting them and leading to their downfall.\r\n\r\nIn this book, God will open your understanding to work on these marks that will reveal the world to you without having to join any evil society or carry out rituals. The elders say “One man’s meats may be another’s man poison”. This means one mark that stands for elevation for you, maybe downfall for another. In this book, it is compulsory for you to work or discover more about the star you have brought into this world before you can understand the secret of this mark. I believe that God will lift you in any situation you may find yourself through this mark. (Amen).\r\n\r\nThe book is different from the interpretation of dreams. That is why I said, you must discover your gift. A lot of interpreters of dreams translate dreams in the same way to people. For instance, if someone dreams of seeing red pepper, an interpreter may say the meaning is affliction while some interpreters will see it as a blessing. In talking about their marks, you may see them in your dreams, and when you wake up, you can bind this mark through prayers. The mark that will be sorrow for others may be a blessing for you. This mark will open your eyes to how the life of a people will be now or in the future. If you see any evil mark on yourself in a dream, it is important for you to fast and pray to destroy it so til will not manifest and destroy you. If you are praying and fasting the way you do when you see yourself die a dream, saying you will not die, also pray like that when someone blesses you with money. Do this and you will see your life get better than it is right now.\r\n\r\n ', 'Show', 'March 01, 2022', 'March 01, 2022'),
